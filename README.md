# IS4310 Modbus STM32 Code Example

This STM32 CubeIDE project communicates with the IS4310 Modbus RTU chip via I2C.

It demonstrates:
* How to read a potentiometer (simulating a sensor) and store its state in **Holding Register 0**.
* How to control an RGB LED (simulating an actuator) using GPIO pins based on values in **Holding Registers 1, 2, and 3**.
